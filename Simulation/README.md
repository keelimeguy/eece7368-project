# Simulation
Contains the SpecC simulation code for the project.

## Usage
`./run.sh`

## Graphing Simulation Results

### Requirements
Tested with Python 3.5.4  

Make sure the packages from "requirements.txt" are installed  
e.g. `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Usage
`python3 graph_audio.py audio.out`

This will also create an image of the graph, at "./audio.png".

### Results
The file "audio.png" shows the sine waveform as generated by the simulated input: "G4G5G6."  
Configurations for the simulation are modified within "./src/mymusic/defs.h"
